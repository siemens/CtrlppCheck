# Request for a change on public repository on [CtrlppCheck](https://github.com/siemens/CtrlppCheck)

## Basic information
<!-- Comment:
A great PR typically begins with the line below.
-->


<!-- replace XXXXX with the numeric part of the issue ID you created in GitHub -->
See #XXXXX
<!-- in case this PR solves Github issue use close #### or closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved -->

<!-- Comment:
If the issue is not fully described in Github, add more information here (justification, pull request links, etc.).

 * We do not require Github issues for minor improvements.
 * Bug fixes should have a Github issue to facilitate the backporting process.
 * Major new features should have a Github issue.

## Technical information


### Testing done

<!-- Comment:
Provide a clear description of how this change was tested.
At minimum this should include proof that a computer has executed the changed lines.
Ideally this should include an automated test or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.
To execute all automated regressions tests start the script /WinCC_OA_Test/executeTests.cmd

Note that automated test coverage is less than complete, so a successful PR build does not necessarily imply that a computer has executed the changed lines.
If automated test coverage does not exist for the lines you are changing, **you must describe** the scenario(s) in which you manually tested the change.
Currently is not possible to start automatic tests on every PR. Therefore provide the tests manually and paste the result (screenshot) here.

For frontend changes, include screenshots of the relevant page(s) before and after the change.

For refactoring and code cleanup changes, exercise the code before and after the change and verify the behavior remains the same.

### Maintainer checklist

Before the changes are marked as `ready-for-merge`:

- [ ] Changelog entries in the **pull request title** and/or **Proposed changelog entries** are accurate, human-readable, and in the imperative mood.
- [ ] C++ and Control(++) code changes are tested by automated test.
- [ ] WinCC OA guidelines for C++ and Control(++) coding have been met.
- [ ] Result of pipeline build proving error/warning free code.
- [ ] Result of automatic tests proving regression free.

<!-- TBD, maybe done in GitHub rules
- [ ] There is at least one (1) approval for the pull request and no outstanding requests for change.
- [ ] Conversations in the pull request are over, or it is explicit that a reviewer is not blocking the change.
- [ ] Proper changelog labels are set so that the changelog can be generated automatically. See also [release-drafter-labels](...).
- [ ] If the change needs additional upgrade steps from users, the `upgrade-guide-needed` label is set and there is a **Proposed upgrade guidelines** section in the pull request title (see [example](...)).
